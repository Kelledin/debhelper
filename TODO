* .so files of compressed manpages -- change to symlinks
* add all other functionality of debstd (??)
* dh_fixperms: allow listing of files not to be touched (diffucult).
* add a dh_debstd, which mimics debstd, but uses debhelper tools internally.
* dh_du: change it so it doesn't grep for things with tabs in them. That's
  nasty. (and makes cut-and-paste from dh_du -v not work).
