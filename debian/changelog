debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.
