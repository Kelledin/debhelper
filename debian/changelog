debhelper (1.2.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: leave .taz and .tgz files alone. Previously trying to
    compress such files caused gzip to fail and the whole command to fail.
    Probably fixes #35677. Actually, it now skips files with a whole
    range of odd suffixes that gzip refuses to compress, including "_z" and
    "-gz".

    suggested starting point if you want to write your own debian/compress

  * autoscripts/*menu*: It turns out that "command" is like test -w, it will
    still return true if update-menus is not executable. This can
    legitimatly happen if you are upgrading the menu package, and it makes
    postinsts that use command fail. Reverted to using test -x. Packages
    built with debhelper >= 1.2.21 that use menus should be rebuilt.

debhelper (1.2.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: linux 2.1.x and 2.2.x differ from earlier versions in that
    they do not clear the suid bit on a file when the owner of that file
    changes. It seems that fakeroot behaves the same as linux 2.1 here. I
    was relying on the old behavior to get rid of suid and sgid bits on files.
    Since this no longer happens implicitly, I've changed to clearing the
    bits explicitly.
  * There's also a small behavior change involved here. Before, dh_fixperms
    did not clear suid permissions on files that were already owned by root.
    Now it does.
  * dh_fixperms.1: cleaned up the docs to mention that those bits are
    cleared.

debhelper (1.2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Added doc-base support, if debian/<package>.doc-base
    exists, it will be installed as a doc-base control file. If you use this,
    you probably want to add "dh_testversion 1.2.21" to the rules file to make
    sure your package is built with a new enough debhelper.
  * dh_installdocs: now supports -n to make it not modify postinst/prerm.
  * dh_suidregister: turned off leading 0/1 in permissions settings, until
    suidregister actually supports it.
  * autoscripts/*: instead of "text -x", use "command -v" to see if various
    binaries exist. This gets rid of lots of hard-coded paths.

  * dh_listpackages: new command. Takes the standard options taken by other

    debhelper command would act on. Added because of bug #30626, and because
    of wn's truely ugly use of debhelper internals to get the same info (and
    because it's just 4 lines of code ;-).
  * dh_compress: is now smart about compressing files that are hardlinks.
    When possible, will only compress one file, delete the hardlinks, and
    re-make hardlinks to the compressed file, saving some disk space.

    it will work on libraries with a major but no minor version in their
    filename (examples of such: libtcl8.0.so.1, libBLT-unoff.so.1)

  * manpages: updated policy version numbers.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior change: all docs are now installed mode 644.
    I have looked and it doesn't seem this will actually affect any packages
    in debian. This is useful only if you want to use dh_installdocs and not
    dh_fixperms, and that's the only time this behavior change will have any
    effect, either. (#30118)

    reason is this: if you're using suidmanager, and you want a file that

    will create a window where it is suid before suidmanager fixes it's
    permissions. This change should be transparent to users and developers.

    registration of a window manager and the necessary modifications to
    postinst and postrm. It's safe to go ahead and start using this for your
    window manager packages, just note that it won't do anything until the new
    xbase is out, and that due to the design of register-window-manager, if
    your wm is installed before a xbase that supports register-window-manager
    is installed, the window manager will never be registered. (#20971)

  * dh_strip: on Richard Braakman's advice, strip the .comment and .note
    sections of shared libraries.
  * Added DH_OPTIONS environment variable - anything in it will be treated
    as additional command line arguments by all debhelper commands. This in
    useful in some situations, for example, if you need to pass -p to all
    debhelper commands that will be run. If you use DH_OPTIONS, be sure to
    use dh_testversion 1.1.17 - older debhelpers will ignore it and do
    things you don't want them to.
  * Made -N properly exclude packages when no -i, -a, or -p flags are
    present. It didn't before, which was a bug.

debhelper (1.1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: remove execute bits from static libraries as well as 
    shared libraries. (#26414)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  4 Sep 1998 14:46:37 -0700

debhelper (1.1.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installmanpages: the new perl version had a nasty habit of 
    installing .so.x library files as man pages. Fixed.
  * dh_installmanpages: the code to exclude searching for man pages in
    debian/tmp directories was broken. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 31 Aug 1998 00:05:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper now has a web page at http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/

  * Added code to debian/rules to update the web page when I release new
    debhelpers.
  * dh_compress: since version 0.88 or so, dh_compress has bombed out if
    a debian/compress file returned an error code. This was actually
    unintentional - in fact, the debian/compress example in the man page
    will fail this way if usr/info or usr/X11R6 is not present. Corrected
    the program to not fail. (#26214)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 30 Aug 1998 22:15:44 -0700

debhelper (1.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: rewritten in perl. Allows me to fix bug #26221 (long
    symlink problem after .so conversion), and is about twice as fast.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 29 Aug 1998 22:06:06 -0700

debhelper (1.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: forgot to pass package name to isnative(). Any native
    debian package that had a debian/TODO would have it installed with the
    wrong name, and debhelper would warn of undefined values for some
    packages. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 27 Aug 1998 12:35:42 -0700

debhelper (1.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installchangelogs: added -k flag, that will make it install a symlink
    to the original name of the upstream changelog.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 20 Aug 1998 15:40:40 -0700

debhelper (1.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's come to my attention that a few packages use filename globbing in
    debian/{docs,examples,whatever} files and expect that to work. It used
    to work before the perl conversion, but it was never _documented_, or
    intented to work. If you use this in your packages, they are broken and
    need fixing (and will refuse to build with current versions of debhelper).
    I apologize for the inconvenience.

  * dh_clean: fixed a bug, intorduced in version 1.1.8, where it didn't
    remove debian/files properly.
  * dh_shlibdeps, dh_testdir, dh_testroot, dh_testversion: converted to perl.
  * Encode the version of debhelper in a sepererate file, so dh_testversion
    doesn't have to be generated when a new version of debhelper is built.
  * Removed bogus menu file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 17 Aug 1998 14:15:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: has been removing the +x bits of all doc/*/examples/* files
    since version 0.97 or so. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 16 Aug 1998 17:11:48 -0700

debhelper (1.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dh_Lib.pm: made U_PARAMS an array of parameters.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: fixed bug in the escaping code, numbers don't need to be
    escaped. Also, no longer escape "-".
  * dh_clean, dh_gencontrol, dh_installcron: converted to perl.
  * dh_gencontrol.1, dh_gencontrol: the man page had said that
    --update-rcd-params was equivilant to -u for this program. You should
    really use --dpkg-gencontrol-params.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 14 Aug 1998 14:07:35 -0700

debhelper (1.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/rules.multi: moved dh_movefiles into the install section.
  * doc/README: Added a note explaining why above change was necessary.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: escape_shell(): now escapes the full range of special
    characters recognized by bash (and ksh). Thanks to Branden Robinson
    <branden@purdue.edu> for looking that up.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 23:32:05 -0700

debhelper (1.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: don't die on symlinks (#25642). (Hope I got the fix right
    this time..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 20:11:13 -0700

debhelper (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_builddeb, dh_installchangelogs: converted to perl.
  * dh_installdirs: converted to perl, getting rid of nasty chdir en-route.
  * dh_installdirs: now you can use absolute directory names too if you
    prefer.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: updated to cover new perl modules.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: doit(): when printing out commands that have run, escape
    metacharacters in the output. I probably don't escape out all the
    characters I should, but this is just a convenience to the user anyway.
  * dh_installdebfiles: it's been broken forever, I fixed it. Obviously
    nobody uses it anymore, which is good, since it's deprected :-)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 15:23:34 -0700

debhelper (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: fixed bug introduced in 1.1.1 where it would fail in some
    cases if you tried to move a broken symlink.
  * dh_installdocs: was only operating on the first package.
  * dh_installexamples: rewritten in perl.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: all multiple package operations were broken.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: implemented complex_doit() and autoscript().
  * Made all perl code work with use strict and -w (well, except
    dh_getopt.pl, but that's a hack that'll go away one day).
  * I didn't realize, but rewriting dh_installdocs in perl fixed bug #24686
    (blank lines in debian/docs file problem), although this same problem 
    applies to other debhelper programs... like dh_installexamples, which had
    the same bug fixed when I rewrote it in perl just now.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: accidentially didn't check DH_VERBOSE if commands were not
    passed any switches.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: --noscripts was broken.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 12:44:04 -0700

debhelper (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: -x was broken since version 1.1.1 - fixed.
  * dh_lib: removed get_arch_indep_packages() function that hasn't been used
    at all for a long while.
  * Added Dh_Lib.pm, a translation of dh_lib into perl.
  * dh_getopt.pl: moved most of it into new Dh_Getopt.pm module, rewriting
    large chunks in the process.
  * dh_installdocs: completly rewritten in perl. Now it's faster and it can
    install many oddly named files it died on before.
  * dh_installdocs: fixed a bug that installed TODO files mode 655 in native
    debian packages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 15:01:15 -0700

debhelper (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: added -X to specify files to not strip (#25590).
  * Added dh_installemacsen, for automatic registration with emacsen-common
    (#21401).
  * Preliminary thoughts in TODO about converting entire debhelper programs
    to perl programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 13:35:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: try to move all files specified, and only then bomb out if
    some of the file could not be found. Makes it easier for some packages
    that don't always have the same files in them.
  * dh_compress: any parameters passed to it on the command line specify
    additional files to be compressed in the first package acted on.
  * dh_compress: recognize standard -A parameter.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 22:48:01 -0700

debhelper (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unstable branch of debhelper.
  
  * TODO: list all current bugs, in order I plan to tackle them.
  * Added debhelper.1 man page, which groups all the debhelper options that
    are common to all commands in once place so I can add new options w/o
    updating 27 man pages.
  * dh_*.1: updated all debheper man pages to refer to debhelper(1) where
    appropriate. Also corrected a host of little errors.
  * doc/README: moved a lot of this file into debhelper.1.
  * dh_*: -N option now excludes a package from the list of packages the 
    programs act on. (#25247)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 17:49:56 -0700

debhelper (1.0) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * 1.0 at last!
  
  * This relelase is not really intended for stable. I throw a copy into
    stable-updates because I want it to be available as an upgrade for
    people using debian 2.0 (the current version in debian 2.0 has no
    critical bugs, but this version is of course a lot nicer), and I plan
    to start work on a new branch of debhelper that will fix many wishlist
    bug reports, and of course introduce many new bugs, and which will go
    into unstable only.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 17:33:20 -0700

debhelper (0.99.4) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.99.3) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.99.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: allow passing of files to move on the command line. Only
    rarely does this make sense. (#25197)

debhelper (0.99) unstable; urgency=low

  * !!!! WARNING: Debhelper (specifically dh_compress) is broken with
    !!!! libtricks. Use fakeroot instead until this is fixed.
  * dh_compress: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to make it not fail if there are no candidates for compression (#24654).
  * Removed a whole debhelper-0.96 tree that had crept into the source
    package by accident.
  * Is version 1.0 next?

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jul 1998 10:03:21 -0700

debhelper (0.98) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: isnative: pass -l<changelog> to dpkg-parsechangelog, to support
    odd packages with multiple different debian changelogs.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: cleaned up the docs on DH_EXCLUDE_FIND.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  6 Jul 1998 12:45:13 -0700

debhelper (0.97) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/from-debstd: fixed a typo.
  * examples/*: install-stamp no longer depends on phony build targey; now 
    install-stamp depends on build-stamp instead (#24234).
  * dh_fixperms: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to fix bad uses of the find command, so it should now work on packages 
    with files with spaces in them (#22005). It's also much cleaner. Thanks,
    Herbert!
  * dh_getopt.pl, doc/PROGRAMMING: added DH_EXCLUDE_FIND, to make the above
    fix work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  5 Jul 1998 18:09:25 -0700

debhelper (0.96) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: fixed so it handles spaces and other odd characters in 
    filenames correctly. (#23046, #23700, #22010)
  * As a side effect, got rid of the nasty temporary file dh_md5sums used
    before.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jun 1998 16:14:42 -0700

debhelper (0.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on file, since several dh_*'s use it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 21:43:51 -0700

debhelper (0.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_gencontrol: pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol to make it include section
    and priority info in the .deb file. Back in Jan 1998, this came up, and
    a consensus was reached on debian-devel that it was a good thing for
    -isp to be used.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 16:15:24 -0700

debhelper (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'd like to thank Len Pikulski and Igor Grobman at nothinbut.net for
    providing me with free internet access on a moment's notice, so I could
    get this package to you after hacking on it all over New England for the
    past week. Thanks, guys!
  .
  * Added dh_debstd, which mimics the functionality of the debstd command.
    It's not a complete nor an exact copy, and it's not so much intended to
    be used in a debian/rules file, as it is to be run by hand when you are
    converting a package from debstd to debhelper. "dh_debstd -v" will
    output the sequence of debhelper commands that approximate what debstd
    would do in the same situation.
  * dh_debstd is completly untested, I don't have the source to any packages
    that use debstd available. Once this is tested, I plan to release 
    debhelper 1.0!
  * Added a from-debstd document that gives a recipe to convert from debstd
    to debhelper.
  * dh_fixperms: can now use -X to exclude files from having their
    permissions changed.
  * dh_testroot: test for uid == 0, instead of username == root, becuase
    some people enjoy changing root's name.
  * dh_installinit: handle debian/init.d as well as debian/init files, 
    for backwards compatability with debstd. Unlike with debstd, the two
    files are treated identically.
  * dh_lib, PROGRAMMING: added "warning" function.
  * Minor man page fixes.
  * dh_compress: don't bomb out if usr/doc/<package> is empty. (#23054)
  * dh_compress, dh_installdirs: always cd into $TMP and back out, even if
    --no-act is on. (#23054)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  1 Jun 1998 21:57:45 -0400

debhelper (0.88) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had many hours on a train to hack on debhelper... enjoy!
  * dh_compress: always pass -f to gzip, to force compression.
  * dh_compress: added -X switch, to make it easy to specify files to
    exclude, without all the bother of a debian/compress script. You can
    use -X multiple times, too.
  * PROGRAMMING, dh_getopt.pl: DH_EXCLUDE is now a variable set by the
    --exclude (-X) switch. -x now sets DH_INCLUDE_CONFFILES.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 17 May 1998 11:26:09 -0700

debhelper (0.87) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: strip .comment and .note, not comment and note, when stripping
    elf binaries. This makes for smaller output files. This has always been
    broken in debhelper before! (#22395)

debhelper (0.86) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: don't try to re-compress *.gz files. Eliminates warning
    messages in some cases, shouldn't actually change the result at all.

debhelper (0.85) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved a few things around that were broken by Che's patch:
    - dh_installdirs should go in install target.
    - dh_clean should not run in binary targets.
  * This is just a quick fix to make it work, I'm not happy with it. I'm
    going to discuss my problems with it with Che, and either make a new
    version fixing them, or revert to 0.83.
  * So be warned that the example rules files are not currently in good
    shape if you're starting a new package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Apr 1998 23:30:38 -0700

debhelper (0.84) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied Che_Fox'x patches to example rules files, which makes them use
    an install target internally to move things into place in debian/tmp.

    Thanks to Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com> and Adam Heath 
    <adam.heath@usa.net> for help on the implementation.
  * dh_installchangelogs: use debian/package.changelog files if they exist
    rather than debian/changelog. It appears some people do need per-package
    changelogs.
  * dh_gencontrol: if debian/package.changelogs files exist, use them.

debhelper (0.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some junk (a whole old debhelper source tree!) that had gotten
    into the source package by accident.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 23 Feb 1998 20:23:34 -0800

debhelper (0.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some debugging output from dh_installmanpages.
  * du_du: no longer does anything, becuase it has been decided on
    debian-policy that du control files are bad.
  * examples/*: removed dh_du calls.
  * debian/rules: removed dh_du call.
  * Modified dh_gencontrol, dh_makeshlibs, and dh_md5sums to generate files 
    with the correct permissions even if the umask is set to unusual 
    values. (#18283)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 16 Feb 1998 23:34:36 -0800

debhelper (0.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: if the man page filename ends in 'x', install it in
    /usr/X11R6/man/.
  * TODO: expanded descriptions of stuff, in the hope someone else will get
    inspired to implement some of it.
  *  Also added all wishlist bugs to the TODO.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 12 Feb 1998 22:38:53 -0800

debhelper (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Add / to end of egrep -v regexp, fixes it so
    debian/icewm.1 can be found.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 11 Feb 1998 09:09:28 -0800

debhelper (0.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make all files readable and writable by owner
    (policy 3.3.8 paragraph 2).
    Lintian found lots of bugs that will be fixed by this change.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 12:26:13 -0800

debhelper (0.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added DH_NO_ACT and --no-act, which make debhelper commands run without
    actually doing anything. (Combine with -v to see what the command would
    have done.) (#17598)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  1 Feb 1998 14:51:08 -0800

debhelper (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug #17597 - DH_VERBOSE wasn'talways taking effect.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 28 Jan 1998 17:18:17 -0500

debhelper (0.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on perl 5.004 or greater (for Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 17 Jan 1998 02:12:06 -0500

debhelper (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: Applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@a2points.com>,
    to make it not abort of one of the find's fails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 1998 19:16:48 -0500

debhelper (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: delete substvarsfiles probperly again (broken in 0.53). #17077
  * Added call to dh_movefiles, and a commented out call to dh_testversion,
    to some of the sample rules files. #17076

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 1998 12:48:43 -0500

debhelper (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: no longer call getopt(1) to parse options. I wrote my own
    argument processor in perl.
  * Added long versions of all arguments. TODO: document them.
  * All parameters may now be passed values that include whitespace (ie,
    dh_installinit -u"defaults 10")
  * Now depends on perl (needs Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 15:44:09 -0500

debhelper (0.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: ignore all man pages installed into debian/tmp
    type directories. (#16933)
  * dh_*: set up alternative name for files like debian/dirs; you may now
    use debian/<mainpackage>.dirs too, for consistency. (#16934)
  * dh_installdocs: if a debian/package.copyright file exists, use it in
    preference to debian/copyright, so subpackages with varying copyrights
    are supported. (#16935)
  * Added dh_movefiles, which moves files out of debian/tmp into subpackages.
    (#16932)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 11:30:12 -0500

debhelper (0.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: compress file belongs in debian/. It was looking in ./
    This has been broken since version 0.30.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jan 1998 14:08:31 -0500

debhelper (0.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make shared libraries non-executable, in accordance with
    policy. (#16644)
  * dh_makeshlibs: introduced a -V flag, which allows you to specify explicit
    version requirements in the shlibs file.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregister,undocumented}:
    Added a -A flag, which makes any files/directories specified on the
    command line apply to ALL packages acted on.
  * Updated Standards-Version to latest.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 1998 16:15:01 -0500

debhelper (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: added -m parameter, which can force the major number
    of the shared library if it is guessed incorrectly.
  * Added dh_testversion to let your package depend on a certian version of
    debhelper to build.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregieter,undocumented}:
    behavior modification - any files/directories specified on the command
    line now apply to the first package acted on. This may not be the
    first package listed in debian/control, if you use -p to make it act on
    a given package, or -i or -a.
  * If you take advantage of the above new behavior, I suggest you add
    "dh_testversion 0.50" to your debian/rules.
  * Display a warning message in cases where the above behavior is triggered,
    and debhelper's behavior has altered.
  * I have grepped debian's source packages, and I'm quite sure this
    is not going to affect any packages currently in debian.
  * dh_lib: isnative() now caches its return value, which should optimize
    away several more calls to dpkg-parsechangelog.
  * README: explain a way to embed debhelper generated shell script into a
    perl script.
  * dh_installinit: A hack to work around the problem in getopt(1) that
    led to bug report #16229: Any text specified on the command line that is
    not a flag will be presumed to be part of the -u flag. Yuck.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jan 1998 14:36:15 -0500

debhelper (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du: Fixed hardcoded debian/tmp.
  * This change got lost by accident, redid it: Optimized out most of the
    slowdown caused by using dpkg-parsechangelog - now it's only called by
    2 dh_* programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 1997 20:45:22 -0500

debhelper (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_undocumented: exit with an error message if the man page specified
    does not have a section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 27 Dec 1997 14:14:04 -0500

debhelper (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: use dpkg-parsechangelog instead of parsing it by hand. This
    makes a package build slower (by about 30 seconds, on average), so
    I might remove it or optimize it if too many people yell at me. :-)
  * dh_undocumented.1: note that it really links to undocumented.7.gz.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 22:19:39 -0500

debhelper (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo #16215.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 14:41:46 -0500

debhelper (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: use prefix, instead of PREFIX, becuase autoconf uses that.
    Also, use `pwd`/debian/tmp, instead of debian/tmp.
  * Always substitute #DEBHELPER# in maintainer scripts, even if it expands
    to nothing, for neatness and to save a few bytes. #15863
  * dh_clean: added -k parameter to not delete debian/files. #15789
  * examples/*: use dh_clean -k in the binary targets of all rules files,
    for safety.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:05:41 -0500

debhelper (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split dh_installdebfiles into 3 programs (dh_installdeb, dh_shlibdeps,
    and dh_gencontrol). dh_installdebfiles still works, but is depricated.
  * Added an examples/rules.indep file.
  * examples/rules.multi: changed dh_du -a to dh_du -i in binary-indep
    section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 10 Dec 1997 19:53:13 -0500

debhelper (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sumes, dh_installdirs, dh_compress: fixed assorted cd bugs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  5 Dec 1997 15:08:36 -0500

debhelper (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: don't expand text passed to doit() a second time. This fixes
    #15624, and hopefully doesn't break anything else.
  * A side effect of this (of interest only to the debhelper programmer) is
    that doit() can no longer handle complex commands now. (ie, pipes, `;',
    `&', etc separating multiple commands, or redirection)
  * dh_makeshlibs, dh_md5sums, dh_installdebfiles, dh_du, dh_clean, 
    dh_installdirs: don't pass complex commands to doit().

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  4 Dec 1997 13:56:14 -0500

debhelper (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: fixes type that caused the program to crash (#15536).

debhelper (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdirs: Do not create usr/doc/$PACKAGE directory. Bug #15498
  * README: documented that $PACKAGE can be used in the arguments to some of
    the dh_* programs (#15497).
  * dh_du.1: no, this is not really the dh_md5sums man page (#15499).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 13:01:40 -0500

debhelper (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: was not reading debian/compress file - fixed.

debhelper (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now depends on fileutils (>= 3.16-4), becuase with any earlier version
    of fileutils, install -p will not work (#14680)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:59:43 -0500

debhelper (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Install README.debian as README.Debian (of course,
    README.Debian is installed with the same name..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 1997 01:23:53 -0500

debhelper (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit: on removal, fixed how update-rc.d is called.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 15 Nov 1997 20:43:14 -0500

debhelper (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installinit, which installs an init.d script, and edits the
    postinst, postrm, etc.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 14 Nov 1997 00:45:53 -0500

debhelper (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmenu.1: menufile is in section 5, not 1.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 12 Nov 1997 19:54:48 -0500

debhelper (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added source, diff targets that just print an error.
  * dh_clean: clean up more files - *.orig, *.rej, *.bak, .*.orig, .*.rej, 
    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the
    commands once, and then run them seperatly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:48:36 -0500

debhelper (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installdirs, automatically creates subdirectories (for
    compatability with debstd's debian/dirs file.
  * dh_lib: fixed problem with -P flag.

    matter what their size (#14604) (policy 5.8)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 19:50:36 -0500

debhelper (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: documented what temporary directories are used by default for 
    installing package files into.
  * dh_*: added -P flag, to let a different package build directory be

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: leave permissions on files in /usr/doc/packages/examples
    unchanged.

debhelper (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: behavior modification: do not generate md5sums for conffiles.
    (Thanks to Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpb4@ukc.ac.uk>) #14048.
  * dh_md5sums: can generate conffile md5sums with -x parameter.
  * Added a "converting from debstd" section to the README.
  * Added dh_du, generates a DEBIAN/du file with disk usage stats (#14048).

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_suidregister, interfaces to to the suidmanager package.

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for automatic generation of debian install scripts to
    dh_installmenu and dh_installdebfiles and dh_clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.
