debhelper (0.67) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added PROGRAMMING document that describes the interface of dh_lib, to
    aid others in writing and understanding debhelper programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  6 Mar 1998 12:45:08 -0800

debhelper (0.66) unstable; urgency=low

  * README, dh_testversion.1, dh_movefiles.1: more doc fixes.
  * dh_movefiles: don't check for package names to see if files are being
    moved from one package back into itself, instead, check tmp dir names.
    If you use this behavior, you should use "dh_testversion 0.66".

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  2 Mar 1998 17:50:29 -0800

debhelper (0.65) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs.1, dh_movefiles.1: clarified documentation for Che.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  2 Mar 1998 17:20:39 -0800

debhelper (0.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some junk (a whole old debhelper source tree!) that had gotten
    into the source package by accident.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 23 Feb 1998 20:23:34 -0800

debhelper (0.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some debugging output from dh_installmanpages.
  * du_du: no longer does anything, becuase it has been decided on
    debian-policy that du control files are bad.
  * examples/*: removed dh_du calls.
  * debian/rules: removed dh_du call.
  * Modified dh_gencontrol, dh_makeshlibs, and dh_md5sums to generate files 
    with the correct permissions even if the umask is set to unusual 
    values. (#18283)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 16 Feb 1998 23:34:36 -0800

debhelper (0.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: if the man page filename ends in 'x', install it in
    /usr/X11R6/man/.
  * TODO: expanded descriptions of stuff, in the hope someone else will get
    inspired to implement some of it.
  *  Also added all wishlist bugs to the TODO.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 12 Feb 1998 22:38:53 -0800

debhelper (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Add / to end of egrep -v regexp, fixes it so
    debian/icewm.1 can be found.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 11 Feb 1998 09:09:28 -0800

debhelper (0.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make all files readable and writable by owner
    (policy 3.3.8 paragraph 2).
    Lintian found lots of bugs that will be fixed by this change.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 12:26:13 -0800

debhelper (0.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added DH_NO_ACT and --no-act, which make debhelper commands run without
    actually doing anything. (Combine with -v to see what the command would
    have done.) (#17598)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun,  1 Feb 1998 14:51:08 -0800

debhelper (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug #17597 - DH_VERBOSE wasn'talways taking effect.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 28 Jan 1998 17:18:17 -0500

debhelper (0.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on perl 5.004 or greater (for Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 17 Jan 1998 02:12:06 -0500

debhelper (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: Applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@a2points.com>,
    to make it not abort of one of the find's fails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 1998 19:16:48 -0500

debhelper (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: delete substvarsfiles probperly again (broken in 0.53). #17077
  * Added call to dh_movefiles, and a commented out call to dh_testversion,
    to some of the sample rules files. #17076

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 1998 12:48:43 -0500

debhelper (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: no longer call getopt(1) to parse options. I wrote my own
    argument processor in perl.
  * Added long versions of all arguments. TODO: document them.
  * All parameters may now be passed values that include whitespace (ie,
    dh_installinit -u"defaults 10")
  * Now depends on perl (needs Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 15:44:09 -0500

debhelper (0.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: ignore all man pages installed into debian/tmp
    type directories. (#16933)
  * dh_*: set up alternative name for files like debian/dirs; you may now
    use debian/<mainpackage>.dirs too, for consistency. (#16934)
  * dh_installdocs: if a debian/package.copyright file exists, use it in
    preference to debian/copyright, so subpackages with varying copyrights
    are supported. (#16935)
  * Added dh_movefiles, which moves files out of debian/tmp into subpackages.
    (#16932)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 11:30:12 -0500

debhelper (0.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: compress file belongs in debian/. It was looking in ./
    This has been broken since version 0.30.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jan 1998 14:08:31 -0500

debhelper (0.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make shared libraries non-executable, in accordance with
    policy. (#16644)
  * dh_makeshlibs: introduced a -V flag, which allows you to specify explicit
    version requirements in the shlibs file.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregister,undocumented}:
    Added a -A flag, which makes any files/directories specified on the
    command line apply to ALL packages acted on.
  * Updated Standards-Version to latest.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 1998 16:15:01 -0500

debhelper (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: added -m parameter, which can force the major number
    of the shared library if it is guessed incorrectly.
  * Added dh_testversion to let your package depend on a certian version of
    debhelper to build.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregieter,undocumented}:
    behavior modification - any files/directories specified on the command
    line now apply to the first package acted on. This may not be the
    first package listed in debian/control, if you use -p to make it act on
    a given package, or -i or -a.
  * If you take advantage of the above new behavior, I suggest you add
    "dh_testversion 0.50" to your debian/rules.
  * Display a warning message in cases where the above behavior is triggered,
    and debhelper's behavior has altered.
  * I have grepped debian's source packages, and I'm quite sure this
    is not going to affect any packages currently in debian.
  * dh_lib: isnative() now caches its return value, which should optimize
    away several more calls to dpkg-parsechangelog.
  * README: explain a way to embed debhelper generated shell script into a
    perl script.
  * dh_installinit: A hack to work around the problem in getopt(1) that
    led to bug report #16229: Any text specified on the command line that is
    not a flag will be presumed to be part of the -u flag. Yuck.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jan 1998 14:36:15 -0500

debhelper (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du: Fixed hardcoded debian/tmp.
  * This change got lost by accident, redid it: Optimized out most of the
    slowdown caused by using dpkg-parsechangelog - now it's only called by
    2 dh_* programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 1997 20:45:22 -0500

debhelper (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_undocumented: exit with an error message if the man page specified
    does not have a section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 27 Dec 1997 14:14:04 -0500

debhelper (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: use dpkg-parsechangelog instead of parsing it by hand. This
    makes a package build slower (by about 30 seconds, on average), so
    I might remove it or optimize it if too many people yell at me. :-)
  * dh_undocumented.1: note that it really links to undocumented.7.gz.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 22:19:39 -0500

debhelper (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo #16215.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 14:41:46 -0500

debhelper (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: use prefix, instead of PREFIX, becuase autoconf uses that.
    Also, use `pwd`/debian/tmp, instead of debian/tmp.
  * Always substitute #DEBHELPER# in maintainer scripts, even if it expands
    to nothing, for neatness and to save a few bytes. #15863
  * dh_clean: added -k parameter to not delete debian/files. #15789
  * examples/*: use dh_clean -k in the binary targets of all rules files,
    for safety.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:05:41 -0500

debhelper (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split dh_installdebfiles into 3 programs (dh_installdeb, dh_shlibdeps,
    and dh_gencontrol). dh_installdebfiles still works, but is depricated.
  * Added an examples/rules.indep file.
  * examples/rules.multi: changed dh_du -a to dh_du -i in binary-indep
    section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 10 Dec 1997 19:53:13 -0500

debhelper (0.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed man page typos #15685.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  6 Dec 1997 21:44:58 -0500

debhelper (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sumes, dh_installdirs, dh_compress: fixed assorted cd bugs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  5 Dec 1997 15:08:36 -0500

debhelper (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: don't expand text passed to doit() a second time. This fixes
    #15624, and hopefully doesn't break anything else.
  * A side effect of this (of interest only to the debhelper programmer) is
    that doit() can no longer handle complex commands now. (ie, pipes, `;',
    `&', etc separating multiple commands, or redirection)
  * dh_makeshlibs, dh_md5sums, dh_installdebfiles, dh_du, dh_clean, 
    dh_installdirs: don't pass complex commands to doit().

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  4 Dec 1997 13:56:14 -0500

debhelper (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: fixes type that caused the program to crash (#15536).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed,  3 Dec 1997 13:22:48 -0500

debhelper (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: fixed typoes (one serious).
  * Ran ispell on all the documentation.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 18:48:20 -0500

debhelper (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdirs: Do not create usr/doc/$PACKAGE directory. Bug #15498
  * README: documented that $PACKAGE can be used in the arguments to some of
    the dh_* programs (#15497).
  * dh_du.1: no, this is not really the dh_md5sums man page (#15499).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 13:01:40 -0500

debhelper (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: was not reading debian/compress file - fixed.
  * examples/*: moved dh_clean call to after make clean is run.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 25 Nov 1997 15:43:58 -0500

debhelper (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: no longer clean up empty (0 byte) files (#15240).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 25 Nov 1997 14:29:37 -0500

debhelper (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now depends on fileutils (>= 3.16-4), becuase with any earlier version
    of fileutils, install -p will not work (#14680)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:59:43 -0500

debhelper (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Install README.debian as README.Debian (of course,
    README.Debian is installed with the same name..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 1997 01:23:53 -0500

debhelper (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit: on removal, fixed how update-rc.d is called.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 15 Nov 1997 20:43:14 -0500

debhelper (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installinit, which installs an init.d script, and edits the
    postinst, postrm, etc.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 14 Nov 1997 00:45:53 -0500

debhelper (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmenu.1: menufile is in section 5, not 1.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 12 Nov 1997 19:54:48 -0500

debhelper (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added source, diff targets that just print an error.
  * dh_clean: clean up more files - *.orig, *.rej, *.bak, .*.orig, .*.rej, 
    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the
    commands once, and then run them seperatly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:48:36 -0500

debhelper (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installdirs, automatically creates subdirectories (for
    compatability with debstd's debian/dirs file.
  * dh_lib: fixed problem with -P flag.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri,  7 Nov 1997 16:07:11 -0500

debhelper (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: always compress changelog and upstream changelog, no 
    matter what their size (#14604) (policy 5.8)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 19:50:36 -0500

debhelper (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: documented what temporary directories are used by default for 
    installing package files into.
  * dh_*: added -P flag, to let a different package build directory be
    specified.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: leave permissions on files in /usr/doc/packages/examples
    unchanged.
  * Install examples/rules* executable.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 1997 12:42:33 -0500

debhelper (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_makeshlibs, automatically generates a shlibs file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 20:33:14 -0400

debhelper (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mispelling of dh_md5sums in examples rules files and README.
    (#13990) Thanks, Adrian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 14:35:30 -0400

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: behavior modification: do not generate md5sums for conffiles.
    (Thanks to Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpb4@ukc.ac.uk>) #14048.
  * dh_md5sums: can generate conffile md5sums with -x parameter.
  * Added a "converting from debstd" section to the README.
  * Added dh_du, generates a DEBIAN/du file with disk usage stats (#14048).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 21 Oct 1997 13:17:28 -0400

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_suidregister, interfaces to to the suidmanager package.
  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed typo on man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Oct 1997 20:55:39 -0400

debhelper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_md5sum, generates a md5sums file.
  * dh_clean: fixed to echo all commands when verbose mode is on.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 17 Oct 1997 14:18:26 -0400

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of bashisms - this package should work now if /bin/sh is ash.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 1997 15:24:40 -0400

debhelper (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installcron to install cron jobs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 30 Sep 1997 19:37:41 -0400

debhelper (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_strip to strip binaries and libraries.
  * Fixed several man pages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 28 Sep 1997 20:46:32 -0400

debhelper (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for automatic generation of debian install scripts to
    dh_installmenu and dh_installdebfiles and dh_clean.
  * Removed some pointless uses of cat.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 23 Sep 1997 12:26:12 -0400

debhelper (0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First release. This is a snapshot of my work so far, and it not yet
    ready to replace debstd.
