debhelper (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added source, diff targets that just print an error.
  * dh_clean: clean up more files - *.orig, *.rej, *.bak, .*.orig, .*.rej, 
    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the
    commands once, and then run them seperatly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:48:36 -0500

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 14:35:30 -0400

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of bashisms - this package should work now if /bin/sh is ash.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.
