debhelper (0.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_gencontrol: pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol to make it include section
    and priority info in the .deb file. Back in Jan 1998, this came up, and
    a consensus was reached on debian-devel that it was a good thing for
    -isp to be used.

debhelper (0.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'd like to thank Len Pikulski and Igor Grobman at nothinbut.net for
    providing me with free internet access on a moment's notice, so I could
    get this package to you after hacking on it all over New England for the
    past week. Thanks, guys!
  .
  * Added dh_debstd, which mimics the functionality of the debstd command.
    It's not a complete nor an exact copy, and it's not so much intended to
    be used in a debian/rules file, as it is to be run by hand when you are
    converting a package from debstd to debhelper. "dh_debstd -v" will
    output the sequence of debhelper commands that approximate what debstd
    would do in the same situation.
  * dh_debstd is completly untested, I don't have the source to any packages
    that use debstd available. Once this is tested, I plan to release 
    debhelper 1.0!
  * Added a from-debstd document that gives a recipe to convert from debstd
    to debhelper.
  * dh_fixperms: can now use -X to exclude files from having their
    permissions changed.
  * dh_testroot: test for uid == 0, instead of username == root, becuase
    some people enjoy changing root's name.
  * dh_installinit: handle debian/init.d as well as debian/init files, 
    for backwards compatability with debstd. Unlike with debstd, the two
    files are treated identically.
  * dh_lib, PROGRAMMING: added "warning" function.
  * Minor man page fixes.
  * dh_compress: don't bomb out if usr/doc/<package> is empty. (#23054)
  * dh_compress, dh_installdirs: always cd into $TMP and back out, even if
    --no-act is on. (#23054)

debhelper (0.88) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had many hours on a train to hack on debhelper... enjoy!
  * dh_compress: always pass -f to gzip, to force compression.
  * dh_compress: added -X switch, to make it easy to specify files to
    exclude, without all the bother of a debian/compress script. You can
    use -X multiple times, too.
  * PROGRAMMING, dh_getopt.pl: DH_EXCLUDE is now a variable set by the
    --exclude (-X) switch. -x now sets DH_INCLUDE_CONFFILES.

debhelper (0.87) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: strip .comment and .note, not comment and note, when stripping
    elf binaries. This makes for smaller output files. This has always been
    broken in debhelper before! (#22395)

debhelper (0.86) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: don't try to re-compress *.gz files. Eliminates warning
    messages in some cases, shouldn't actually change the result at all.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 27 Apr 1998 15:21:33 -0700

debhelper (0.85) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved a few things around that were broken by Che's patch:
    - dh_installdirs should go in install target.
    - dh_clean should not run in binary targets.
  * This is just a quick fix to make it work, I'm not happy with it. I'm
    going to discuss my problems with it with Che, and either make a new
    version fixing them, or revert to 0.83.
  * So be warned that the example rules files are not currently in good
    shape if you're starting a new package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Apr 1998 23:30:38 -0700

debhelper (0.84) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied Che_Fox'x patches to example rules files, which makes them use
    an install target internally to move things into place in debian/tmp.

debhelper (0.83) unstable; urgency=low

  * Generate symlinks in build stage of debian/rules. cvs cannot create them
    properly. Note that version 0.80 and 0.81 could not build some packages
    because of missing symlinks.

debhelper (0.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved under cvs (so I can fork a stable and an unstable version).
  * dh_movefiles: first move real files, then move symlinks. (#18220)
    Thanks to Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com> and Adam Heath 
    <adam.heath@usa.net> for help on the implementation.
  * dh_installchangelogs: use debian/package.changelog files if they exist
    rather than debian/changelog. It appears some people do need per-package
    changelogs.
  * dh_gencontrol: if debian/package.changelogs files exist, use them.
  * Above 2 changes close #20442.

debhelper (0.78) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * More spelling fixes from Christian T. Steigies. (I ignored the spelling
    fixes to the changelog, though - too many, and a changelog isn't meant
    to be changed after the fact :-)
  * dh_fixperms: remove execute bits from .la files genrated by libtool.

debhelper (0.74) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: convert .so links to symlinks at last (#19829).

    installs symlink man pages from the source package (#19831).
  * dh_installmanpages: minor speedups
  * PROGRAMMING: numerous spelling fixes, thanks to Christian T. Steigies.
    Life is too short for me to spell check my technical documentation, but
    I always welcome corrections!

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Mar 1998 17:12:04 -0800

debhelper (0.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: -V flag was broken: if just -V was specified,
    dh_makeshlibs would die. Corrected this.
  * dh_lib: removed warning if the arguments passed to a debhelper command
    do not apply to the main package. It's been long enough so I'm 100% sure
    no packages use the old behavior.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Mar 1998 11:46:59 -0800

debhelper (0.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: autoscript(): no longer add the modification date to the
    comments aurrounding debhelper-added code. I don't think this date was
    gaining us anything, so let's remove it and save some disk space.

debhelper (0.69) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refer to suidregister (8), not (1). Bug #19149.

debhelper (0.66) unstable; urgency=low

  * README, dh_testversion.1, dh_movefiles.1: more doc fixes.
  * dh_movefiles: don't check for package names to see if files are being
    moved from one package back into itself, instead, check tmp dir names.
    If you use this behavior, you should use "dh_testversion 0.66".

debhelper (0.65) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some debugging output from dh_installmanpages.

    debian-policy that du control files are bad.
  * examples/*: removed dh_du calls.
  * debian/rules: removed dh_du call.
  * Modified dh_gencontrol, dh_makeshlibs, and dh_md5sums to generate files 
    with the correct permissions even if the umask is set to unusual 
    values. (#18283)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 16 Feb 1998 23:34:36 -0800

debhelper (0.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: if the man page filename ends in 'x', install it in
    /usr/X11R6/man/.
  * TODO: expanded descriptions of stuff, in the hope someone else will get
    inspired to implement some of it.
  *  Also added all wishlist bugs to the TODO.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 12 Feb 1998 22:38:53 -0800

debhelper (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Add / to end of egrep -v regexp, fixes it so
    debian/icewm.1 can be found.

debhelper (0.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make all files readable and writable by owner
    (policy 3.3.8 paragraph 2).
    Lintian found lots of bugs that will be fixed by this change.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 12:26:13 -0800

debhelper (0.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added DH_NO_ACT and --no-act, which make debhelper commands run without
    actually doing anything. (Combine with -v to see what the command would
    have done.) (#17598)

debhelper (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: delete substvarsfiles probperly again (broken in 0.53). #17077
  * Added call to dh_movefiles, and a commented out call to dh_testversion,
    to some of the sample rules files. #17076

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 1998 12:48:43 -0500

debhelper (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: no longer call getopt(1) to parse options. I wrote my own
    argument processor in perl.
  * Added long versions of all arguments. TODO: document them.
  * All parameters may now be passed values that include whitespace (ie,
    dh_installinit -u"defaults 10")
  * Now depends on perl (needs Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 15:44:09 -0500

debhelper (0.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: ignore all man pages installed into debian/tmp
    type directories. (#16933)
  * dh_*: set up alternative name for files like debian/dirs; you may now
    use debian/<mainpackage>.dirs too, for consistency. (#16934)
  * dh_installdocs: if a debian/package.copyright file exists, use it in
    preference to debian/copyright, so subpackages with varying copyrights
    are supported. (#16935)
  * Added dh_movefiles, which moves files out of debian/tmp into subpackages.
    (#16932)

    This has been broken since version 0.30.

debhelper (0.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make shared libraries non-executable, in accordance with
    policy. (#16644)
  * dh_makeshlibs: introduced a -V flag, which allows you to specify explicit
    version requirements in the shlibs file.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregister,undocumented}:
    Added a -A flag, which makes any files/directories specified on the
    command line apply to ALL packages acted on.
  * Updated Standards-Version to latest.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 1998 16:15:01 -0500

debhelper (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: added -m parameter, which can force the major number
    of the shared library if it is guessed incorrectly.
  * Added dh_testversion to let your package depend on a certian version of
    debhelper to build.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregieter,undocumented}:
    behavior modification - any files/directories specified on the command
    line now apply to the first package acted on. This may not be the
    first package listed in debian/control, if you use -p to make it act on
    a given package, or -i or -a.
  * If you take advantage of the above new behavior, I suggest you add
    "dh_testversion 0.50" to your debian/rules.
  * Display a warning message in cases where the above behavior is triggered,
    and debhelper's behavior has altered.
  * I have grepped debian's source packages, and I'm quite sure this
    is not going to affect any packages currently in debian.
  * dh_lib: isnative() now caches its return value, which should optimize
    away several more calls to dpkg-parsechangelog.
  * README: explain a way to embed debhelper generated shell script into a
    perl script.
  * dh_installinit: A hack to work around the problem in getopt(1) that
    led to bug report #16229: Any text specified on the command line that is
    not a flag will be presumed to be part of the -u flag. Yuck.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jan 1998 14:36:15 -0500

debhelper (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du: Fixed hardcoded debian/tmp.
  * This change got lost by accident, redid it: Optimized out most of the
    slowdown caused by using dpkg-parsechangelog - now it's only called by
    2 dh_* programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 1997 20:45:22 -0500

debhelper (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_undocumented: exit with an error message if the man page specified
    does not have a section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 27 Dec 1997 14:14:04 -0500

debhelper (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: use dpkg-parsechangelog instead of parsing it by hand. This
    makes a package build slower (by about 30 seconds, on average), so
    I might remove it or optimize it if too many people yell at me. :-)
  * dh_undocumented.1: note that it really links to undocumented.7.gz.

    Also, use `pwd`/debian/tmp, instead of debian/tmp.
  * Always substitute #DEBHELPER# in maintainer scripts, even if it expands
    to nothing, for neatness and to save a few bytes. #15863
  * dh_clean: added -k parameter to not delete debian/files. #15789
  * examples/*: use dh_clean -k in the binary targets of all rules files,

debhelper (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split dh_installdebfiles into 3 programs (dh_installdeb, dh_shlibdeps,
    and dh_gencontrol). dh_installdebfiles still works, but is depricated.
  * Added an examples/rules.indep file.
  * examples/rules.multi: changed dh_du -a to dh_du -i in binary-indep

debhelper (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: don't expand text passed to doit() a second time. This fixes
    #15624, and hopefully doesn't break anything else.
  * A side effect of this (of interest only to the debhelper programmer) is
    that doit() can no longer handle complex commands now. (ie, pipes, `;',
    `&', etc separating multiple commands, or redirection)
  * dh_makeshlibs, dh_md5sums, dh_installdebfiles, dh_du, dh_clean, 
    dh_installdirs: don't pass complex commands to doit().

    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: leave permissions on files in /usr/doc/packages/examples
    unchanged.

debhelper (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mispelling of dh_md5sums in examples rules files and README.
    (#13990) Thanks, Adrian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 14:35:30 -0400

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: behavior modification: do not generate md5sums for conffiles.
    (Thanks to Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpb4@ukc.ac.uk>) #14048.
  * dh_md5sums: can generate conffile md5sums with -x parameter.
  * Added a "converting from debstd" section to the README.

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_suidregister, interfaces to to the suidmanager package.
  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed typo on man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 18 Oct 1997 20:55:39 -0400

debhelper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_md5sum, generates a md5sums file.
  * dh_clean: fixed to echo all commands when verbose mode is on.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 17 Oct 1997 14:18:26 -0400

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of bashisms - this package should work now if /bin/sh is ash.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 1997 15:24:40 -0400

debhelper (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installcron to install cron jobs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 30 Sep 1997 19:37:41 -0400

debhelper (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_strip to strip binaries and libraries.
  * Fixed several man pages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 28 Sep 1997 20:46:32 -0400

debhelper (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for automatic generation of debian install scripts to
    dh_installmenu and dh_installdebfiles and dh_clean.
  * Removed some pointless uses of cat.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 23 Sep 1997 12:26:12 -0400

debhelper (0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First release. This is a snapshot of my work so far, and it not yet
    ready to replace debstd.
