.TH DH_DEBSTD 1
.SH NAME
dh_debstd \- mimic debstd with debhelper commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_debstd
.I "[-v] [--no-act] [-m] [-c] [-u] [-s] [[changelog] file ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_debstd is a debhelper command that mimics the behavior of debstd, by
calling other debhelper commands. Its behavior is not a complete nor an
exact copy of what debstd does, but it should be close enough to be usable.
.P
dh_debstd is not intended to really be used in building an official debian
package. Instead, it is intended to help you convert your package that uses
debstd over to debhelper. If you run dh_debstd with the same parameters you
passed to debstd, and use the --verbose and --no-act flags, you can see what
debhelper commands dh_debstd runs, and copy those commands into debian/rules
to get a start on converting to debhelper.
.P
See
.BR debstd (1)
for a complete description of what this program does.
.SH "DEBHELPER STYLE OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-v, \--verbose
Verbose mode; show all commands that modify the package build directory.
.TP
.B \--no-act
Do not really do anything. If used with -v, the result is that this command
will output a list of what it would have done.
.SH "DEBSTD STYLE OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-m
Switch off automatic man page installation.
.TP
.B \-c
Switch off automatic file compression.

.TP
.B changelog
Install this file as the upstream changelog. Only happens if it's name
contains "change", "news", or "history" (not case sensative).
.TP
.B file ...
Install these files as documentation.
.SH NOTES
Unlike debstd, dh_debstd does not automatically modify maintainer scripts
such as the postinst, posrm, etc. To get those scripts to be modified, you
have to place "#DEBHELPER#" in them at the location you want debhelper to
insert commands. To help you remember to do that, a warning message will be
generated if dh_debstd notices scripts without "#DEBHELPER#" in them.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.I DH_VERBOSE
Enables verbose mode
.TP
.I DH_NO_ACT
Enables no-act mode (see above).

.SH BUGS
It doesn't completly mimic debstd. Some things debstd handles are not supported
by debhelper. With the exception of buildinfo.Debian files, everything that
is not supported will generate a warning message.
