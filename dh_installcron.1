.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installcron
.I "[debhelper options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installcron is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
cron scripts into etc/cron.* in package build directories. The files
debian/cron.daily, debian/cron.weekly, debian/cron.monthly, and debian/cron.d
are installed. If your package generates multiple binary packages (or if you
just prefer to do it), you can also use filenames like 
debian/package.cron.daily, where "package" is replaced with the name of the 
binary package this cron script goes into.
