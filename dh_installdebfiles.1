.TH DH_INSTALLDEBFILES 1
.SH NAME
dh_installdebfiles \- install files into the DEBIAN directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installdebfils
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installdebfiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files into the DEBIAN directory in package build directories with the
correct permissions.
.P
dh_installdocs automatically installs the following files from debian/ into
the DEBIAN directory:
.IP postinst
.IP preinst
.IP postrm
.IP prerm
.IP shlibs
.IP conffiles
.P
(For packages other than the first binary package listed in debian/control,
prefix these filenames with then name of the "package.", for example, 
"foo.postinst".)
.P
The files postinst, preinst, postrm, and prerm are handled specially: If a
corresponding file named debian/script.debhelper exists, the contents of that 
file are merged into the script as follows: If the script exists, then 
anywhere in it that "#DEBHELPER#" appears, the text of the .debhelper file is
inserted. If the script does not exist, then a script is generated from 
the .debhelper file. The .debhelper files are created by other debhelper 
programs, such as 
.BR dh_installmenu (1)
, and are shell scripts.
.P
In addition, it will generate a DEBIAN/control file, by running
.BR dpkg-shlibdeps (1)
and
.BR dpkg-gencontrol (1)
