.TH DH_INSTALLDOCS 1
.SH NAME
dh_installdocs \- install documentation into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installdocs
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir] [-A] [file ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installdocs is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
documentation into usr/doc/package in package build directories.
.P
dh_installdocs automatically installs debian/copyright if it exists. If
dh_installdocs is acting on multiple packages, debian/copyright files will be
installed into all packages.
.P
Any filenames specified as parameters will be installed into the first
package dh_installdocs is told to act on. By default, this is the first 
binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it 
will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
Also,  debian/README.Debian (or debian/README.debian) and debian/TODO, if 
they exist, will be installed into the first binary package listed in 
debian/control, if dh_installdocs is acting on that package. Note that 
debian/TODO will be installed named TODO.Debian, if the package is not a 
debian native package.
.P
A file named debian/docs (for the first binary package in debian/control),
or debian/package.docs (for each additional package in debian/control) can
list other files to be installed.
