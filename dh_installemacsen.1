.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installemacsen is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files used by the debian emacsen-common package into package build directories. 
.P
It also automatically generates the postinst and prerm commands needed to 
register a package as an emacs add on package. See 
.BR dh_installdeb (1)
for an explanation of how this works.
.P
If a file named debian/package.emacsen-install exists, then it is installed into
usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/install/package in the package build
directory. Similarly, debian/package.emacsen-remove is installed into
usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/remove/package
.P
For the first first binary package listed in the control file, you may use
debian/emacsen-install and debian/emacsen-remove instead.
