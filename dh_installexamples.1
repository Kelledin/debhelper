.SH NAME
dh_installexamples \- install example files into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installexamples
.I "[debhelper options] [-A] [file ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installexamples is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
examples into usr/doc/package/examples in package build directories.
.P
Any file names specified as parameters will be installed into the first 
package dh_installexamples is told to act on. By default, this is the first 
binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it
will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
A file named debian/package.examples (debian/examples may be used for the
first binary package in debian/control) can list other files to be installed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B debhelper options
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of options common to all debhelper commands.
.TP
.B \-A, \--all
Install any files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages
acted on.
.TP
.B file ...
Install these files as examples into the first package acted on. (Or into all
packages if -A is specified.)
.SH NOTES
Note that dh_installexamples will happily copy entire directory hierarchies if
you ask it to (it uses cp -a internally). If it is asked to install a
directory, it will install the complete contents of the directory.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of environment variables that affect all debhelper commands.

.SH BUGS
It's impossible to specify filenames with spaces or other whitespace in them
in debian/examples file. This is more a historical design flaw than a bug.
