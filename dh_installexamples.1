.SH NAME
dh_installexamples \- install example files into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installexamples
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir] [-A] [file ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installexamples is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
examples into usr/doc/package/examples in package build directories.
.P
Any file names specified as parameters will be installed into the first 
package dh_installdirs is told to act on. By default, this is the first 
binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it
will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
A file named debian/package.examples (debian/examples may be used for the
first binary package in debian/control) can list other files to be installed.
