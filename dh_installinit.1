.SH NAME
dh_installinit \- install init scripts into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installinit
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [--no-act] [--init-script=scriptname] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir] [-n] [-r] [-d] [-uparams]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installinit is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
init scripts into package build directories. 
.P
It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm and prerm commands 
needed to set up the symlinks in /etc/rc*.d/ and to start and stop the init
scripts.
.P
If a file named debian/package.init exists, then it is installed into
etc/init.d/package in the package build directory, with "package" replaced
by the packagename. (You may use debian/init for the first binary package
listed in the control file.)

.TP
.B \-i, \--indep

filename the init script is installed as in etc/init.d/ . This may be useful
for daemons with named ending in "d". (Note: this takes precidence over
the --init-script parameter described below.)
