.SH NAME
dh_installinit \- install init scripts into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installinit
.I "[debhelper options] [--init-script=scriptname] [-n] [-r] [-d] [-uparams]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installinit is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
init scripts into package build directories. 
.P
It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm and prerm commands 
needed to set up the symlinks in /etc/rc*.d/ and to start and stop the init
scripts.
.P
If a file named debian/package.init (or debian/package.init.d for backwards
compatibility with debstd) exists, then it is installed into
etc/init.d/package in the package build directory, with "package" replaced
by the packagename. (You may use debian/init for the first binary package
listed in the control file.)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B debhelper options
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of options common to all debhelper commands.
.TP
.B \-n, \--noscripts
Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.
.TP
.B \-r, \--no-restart-on-upgrade
Do not restart daemon on upgrade.
.TP
.B \-d, \--remove-d
Remove trailing "d" from the name of the package, and use the result for the
filename the init script is installed as in etc/init.d/ . This may be useful
for daemons with names ending in "d". (Note: this takes precedence over
the --init-script parameter described below.)
.TP
.B \-uparams, \--update-rcd-params=params
Pass "params" to 
.BR update-rc.d (8)
If not specified, "defaults" will be passed to
.BR update-rc.d (8)
.TP
.B \--init-script=scriptname
Use "scriptname" as for the filename the init script is installed as in
etc/init.d/ . This is useful if you need to have an init script with a name
different from the package's name.
