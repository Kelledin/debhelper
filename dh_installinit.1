.TH DH_INSTALLINIT 1
.SH NAME
dh_installinit \- install init scripts into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installinit
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir] [-n] [-r] [-d] [-uparams]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installinit is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
init scripts into package build directories. 
.P
It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm and prerm commands 
needed to set up the symlinks in /etc/rc*.d/ and to start and stop the init
scripts.
.P
If a file named debian/init exists, then it is installed into
etc/init.d/package in the package build directory (with "package" replaced
by the package name, unless the -d flag is specified, see below)
.P
For packages other than the first binary package listed in
the control file, use debian/package.init instead (replace "package" with 
the name of the package.)
