.TH DH_INSTALLMENU 1
.SH NAME
dh_installmenu \- install debian menu files into package build directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_installmenu
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [--no-act] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir] [-n]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_installmenu is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
files used by the debian menu package into package build directories. 
.P
It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands needed to 
interface with the debian menu package. See 
.BR dh_installdeb (1)
for an explanation of how this works.
.P
If a file named debian/package.menu exists, then it is installed into
usr/lib/menu/package in the package build directory. This is a debian menu
file.
.P
If a file named debian/package.menu-method exits, then it is installed into
etc/menu-methods/package in the package build directory. This is a debian
menu method file.
.P
For the first first binary package listed in the control file, you may use
debian/menu and debian/menu-method instead.
