.SH NAME
dh_movefiles \- move files out of debian/tmp into subpackages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_movefiles
.I "[debhelper options] [--sourcedir=dir] [file ..]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_movefiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for moving files out
of debian/tmp or some other directory and into other package build 
directories. This may be useful if your package has a Makefile that installs
everything into debian/tmp, and you need to break that up into subpackages.
.P
Files named debian/package.files list the files to be moved, separated by
whitespace. The filenames listed should be relative to debian/tmp/. You can
also list directory names, and the whole directory will be moved. You can
even use wildcards if you like. If you prefer, you can list the files to
move on the command line and this will apply to the first package
dh_movefiles is told to act on.
.P
The files will be moved in a special order: first all normal files, then all
symlinks. This is done becuase it tends to be a good thing to have symlinks
last in debian packages, particularly in shared library packages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B debhelper options
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of options common to all debhelper commands.
.TP
.B --sourcedir=dir
Instead of moveing files out of debian/tmp (the default), this option makes
it move files out of some other directory. Since the entire contents of
the sourcedir is moved, specifiying something like --sourcedir=/ is very
unsafe, so to prevent mistakes, the sourcedir must be a relative filename; it
cannot begin with a `/'.
.TP
.B file ..
Lists files to move. The filenames listed should be relative to debian/tmp/.
You can also list directory names, and the whole directory will be moved. You
can even use wildcards if you like. It is an error to list files here unless
you use -p, -i, or -a to tell dh_movefiles which subpackage to put them in.
