.TH DH_PERL 1 "22 June 1999" "Debhelper Commands" "Debhelper Commands"
.SH NAME
dh_perl \- calculates perl scripts & modules dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_perl
.I "[debhelper options] [-k] [-d] [library dirs ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_perl is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
the perl:Depends substitutions and adding them to substvars files. 
.P
The program will look for the location of installed modules and will
use this information to generate a dependency (at the present time
it can only be perl5, perl5-thread, perl-5.00X or perl-5.00X-thread).
.P
It will also look at #! lines of perl scripts in order to be able
to calculate a dependency for perl scripts and not only perl modules.
.P
In addition it will automatically remove .packlist file and will
remove the directory in which it was if it's empty. You can
switch off this option by passing -k.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B debhelper options
See
.BR debhelper (1)
for a list of options common to all debhelper commands.
.TP
.B -k
Keep .packlist files.
.TP
.B -d
In some specific cases you may want to depend on a -base package
(ie perl-5.00X-base or perl5-base). If so, you can pass
the -d option to make
.BR dh_perl 
generate a dependency on the correct base package. This is only necessary
for some modules that are included in the base system.
.TP
.B library dirs
If your package does install perl modules in non-standard 
directories, you can make
.BR dh_perl
check those directories by passing their names on the command line.
.BR dh_perl
will only check usr/lib/perl5 by default.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
See
.BR debhelper (1)
