.SH NAME
dh_shlibdeps \- calculate shared library dependancies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_shlibdeps
.I "[-v] [-a] [-i] [--no-act] [-ppackage] [-Ptmpdir] [-uparams]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_shlibdeps is a debhelper program that is responsible for calculating
shared library dependancies for all executables found in the package build
directory.
.P
This program is merely a wrapper around
.BR dpkg-shlibdeps (1)
that calls it once for each package listed in the control file. You may 
prefer to simply run 
.BR dpkg-shlibdeps (1)
by hand.
.SH OPTIONS

Install files for all architecture dependent packages.
.TP
.B \-i, \--indep
