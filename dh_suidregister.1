.SH NAME
dh_suidregister \- set up package to register files with suidregister
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_suidregister
.I "[debhelper options] [-A] [file ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_suidregister is a debhelper program that is responsible for modifying the
postinst and postrm scripts of a package so the package will register files
with 
.BR suidregister (1)
when it is installed.
.P
Any filenames specified as parameters will be registered in the first 
package dh_suidregister is told to act on. By default, this is the first 
binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, 
it will be the first package specified by those flags.
.P
Files named debian/package.suid (or debian/suid for the first binary package
in debian/control) can list other files to be registered.
.P
If neither of these methods is used to specify files, dh_suidregister will
scan the package build directory for files that have suid permissions, and
will automatically register all files it finds.
.P
Note that this program modifies your postinst and postrm files. See
.BR dh_installdeb (1)
for an explanation of how this works.
.P
Also note that all files registered by this program will *not* be suid in the
resulting .deb file. The postinst of the package will set their permissions
(even if the user doesn't have suidmanager installed).

with other debhelper programs.
