dh_undocumented \- make symlinks to undocumented.7.gz man page
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh_undocumented
.I "[debhelper options [-A] [manpage ...]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
dh_undocumented is a debhelper program that is responsible for making
symlinks to the
.BR undocumented (7)
man page for man pages that are not present in your package.
.P
The program takes a list of man pages that should be symlinked to
.BR undocumented (7)
It determines what directory the man pages should be placed in by examining
their extensions - pages ending in "x" go into /usr/X11R6/man/, while pages
that end in anything else go in /usr/man/. It also examines the extention to
see what section the man page belongs in. After figuring this out, it
generates the necessary symlinks to
.BR undocumented (7)
, placing the sylinks in the package build directory.
.P
The lists of man pages that need 
.BR undocumented (7)
symlinks can be specified in two ways. Any man page names specified as
parameters will be set up in the first package dh_undocumented is told
to act on. By default, this is the first binary package in debian/control, 
but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags, it will be the first package specified 
by those flags.
Also, a file named debian/package.undocumented (or debian/undocumented, for 
the first binary package in debian/control) can list other man page names to
set up.
