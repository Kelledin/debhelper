* add all other functionality of debstd (??)
  - add a program to generate file similar to buildinfo.Debian generated by
    debmake (wishlist bug #17043). I just never saw the point of that file..
  - Make dh_movefiles remove emptied directories after it's moved all the
    files out of them (wishlist bug #17111).
* something should add ldconfig calls properly to the postinst of packages
  that contain shared libraries. maybe dh_makeshlibs? But it wasn't designed
  to do that originally, and even worse, it is often run after
  dh_installdeb, so the fragements wouldn't go into the postinst. So maybe a
  new script is called for.
* info support for debhelper (currently implemented, but I hate how I did it,
  so it's not in the package.) (wishlist bug #15717)
* enhance dh_installmanpages so it associates binaries and man pages and
  installs the man pages into the correct areas to suit the binaries they
  document. I may need to make this only happen when a switch is given, to
  preserve backward compatibility.
* maybe make dh_installmanpages look at the .TH line of man pages whose
  filenames end in .man, to figure out what section they go it. This would
  require a switch to turn on, for backwards compatibility.
* All debhelper programs should be checked that they output files with the
  correct permissions no matter what the umask is set to. Currently, only
  those programs that run after dh_fixperms have been so checked. (Checking
  the rest is low priority, since dh_fixperms fixes any incorrect permissions
  they might have; still it would be nice to check them too, just to make
  debhelper more flexible.) One easy fix is to add umask 022 to dh_lib,
  however, there may be unforeseen ramifications of such a change.
