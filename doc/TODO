This is the TODO for debhelper. As more and more people use debhelper, this
list grows - I welcome patches to fix items on it!

Bugs:

* dh_installdocs fails if debian/docs is empty except for a blank line.
  There are probably other instances of this. Debhelper should behave better
  (#24686).
* all commands should print a warning message if non-cumulative parameters
  are given more than once (ie, two -u's to dh_gencontrol).

Wishlist items:

* Make dh_movefiles remove emptied directories after it's moved all the
  files out of them (#17111).
* info support for debhelper (currently implemented, but I hate how I did it,
  so it's not in the package.) (#15717)
* enhance dh_installmanpages so it associates binaries and man pages and
  installs the man pages into the correct areas to suit the binaries they
  document. I may need to make this only happen when a switch is given, to
  preserve backward compatibility. (#16933, #17061)
* maybe make dh_installmanpages look at the .TH line of man pages whose
  filenames end in .man, to figure out what section they go it. This would
  require a switch to turn on, for backwards compatibility.
* All debhelper programs should be checked that they output files with the
  correct permissions no matter what the umask is set to. Currently, only
  those programs that run after dh_fixperms have been so checked. (Checking
  the rest is low priority, since dh_fixperms fixes any incorrect permissions
  they might have; still it would be nice to check them too, just to make
  debhelper more flexible.) One easy fix is to add umask 022 to dh_lib,
  however, there may be unforeseen ramifications of such a change.
* something should add ldconfig calls properly to the postinst of packages
  that contain shared libraries. maybe dh_makeshlibs? But it wasn't designed
  to do that originally, and even worse, it is often run after
  dh_installdeb, so the fragements wouldn't go into the postinst. So maybe a
  new script is called for.
* docbase support (#25233). Waiting for docbase to stabalize and be used
  widly.
* Support /etc/X11/window-managers, by making it easy for window managers to
  add themselves to it in the postinst. Not high priority because there are 
  few window managers. (#20971)
* dhelp support. Currently pending on dhelp use becoming widespead (#18342)
* Support use of environment variables in data taken from user, ie, in
  debian/dirs. The problem with doing this is that we really want to allow
  any filenames in that input, even those that look like environment
  variables. However, it may be worth adding a switch to make it parse
  environment variables. (#20964)
* It's possible to speed up debhelper by having it cache some values that
  multiple commands call. One way to do this would be to write dh_cache,
  that generates the cache. The catch is that if the user runs that program,
  they are stating that they don't do anything later to invalidate the cache,
  without calling ch_cache again. (#23792)
* Add a switch to dh_installdeb to allow it to do user definied
  substitutions. (#25235)

Depricated:

* remove dh_installdebfiles, dh_du.
	- need to wait a reasonable length of time. I'm currently planning
	  on doing this after slink is released.

Long term goals:

Convert selected and then selected debhelper commands (dh_installmanpages?)
to be perl programs, for speed, ease of maintainence, and 8-bit cleanness.
Tricky, because of the -v option -- they'd have to call external commands
like install and cp, and log such calls if verbose was on. Maybe something
like:

doit {
	system @_;
	if ($DH_VERBOSE) {
		print join " ", @_;
	}
}

However, this will output commands that are incorrect if the filenames in
them contain spaces or other weird characters. Hmm, maybe such things should
just be escaped with \'s in the output?
